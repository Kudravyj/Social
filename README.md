Hello that's my project for portfolio. 

I made a relational database for social network. I used Laravel and Sqlite. There is three controllers and three models. 
For change the Db just update env. file and add your connection.

What it can? 

Like any other social network, you can create your profile, change its appearance, add photos, create a post. 
And also find your friend and subscribe to him. You can see all who follow you and those who follow you. You will also see the posts of everyone who subscribed to you.
But it also differs from other social networks. For example, this is a change in the appearance of the profile by changing the color or adding a photo to the background.


For project I used:
-Laravel
-Restful API
-SQLite DB
-Node js
-Three controllers
-Three Models
